MeetUp 009c - Beginners Python Support Sessions 1-May-2019

Learning objectives:
    Data types: Dataframe
    Module: pandas

@author D Tim Cummings

Challenge is to read csv file containing three columns
    'race' = the date of the race
    'runner' = the name of the runner running in the race
    'time' = the time in seconds the runner took to run 5 km.

Find the winner of each race
Find each runners fastest time
Show places for each runner in each race


For those using PyCharm Edu - you need to install pandas by installing the library in your requirements.txt file
in the same directory as your python file.

Do not call this file pandas.py because when you import pandas, python will import your python file not the pandas library.

import pandas as pd

df_raw = pd.read_csv('run_results.csv')
print(df_raw)

# df_raw is our variable name which stores a pandas DataFrame of the raw data from the csv file.
# In pandas a DataFrame is a two dimensional collection of data (many rows and many columns),
# In pandas a Series is a one dimensional collection of data (many rows and one column)
# A DataFrame has an index, columns and values
# For df_raw the index is the numbers 0 to 80,
# columns are the heading names from the first line in the csv file ('race', 'runner', 'time')
# values are the data from all remaining lines in the csv file
#
# DataFrame.pivot(index=None, columns=None, values=None) is used to return a reshaped DataFrame organized by given index / column values.

df = df_raw.pivot(index='runner', columns='race', values='time')
print(df)
# For df the index is the names of the runners ('Annie', 'Bennie', ... 'Sam')
# columns are the dates of the races as strings ('2019-01-28', '2019-02-04', ... '2019-04-01')
# values are the times for each runner for each race (1521, 1596, ... 1772)


# to print who won each race we can use the for loop. df.columns contains all the race dates as strings

for race in df.columns:
    # race is a string containing the date of the race, eg '2019-01-28'
    # times is a pandas Series containing all the times of the race sorted in ascending order. If runner didn't run that race their time is NaN (not a number)
    # times.index is the names of the runners for those times. It is the index of the pandas Series times.
    times = df[race].sort_values()
    print(times)
    # times[0] is the fastest time because times is in ascending order
    # times.index[0] is the runner who had the fastest time
    print(times[0], times.index[0], race)


# DataFrame.transpose will transpose index and columns i.e., Reflect the DataFrame over its main diagonal by writing rows as columns and vice-versa.
# The property T is an accessor to the method transpose().

dft = df.T

# the challenge is to find the fastest time of each runner

print(dft)

# the solution

for runner in dft.columns:
    fastest_time = dft[runner].sort_values()
    print(fastest_time[0], runner)


# advanced challenge:
#   display the place of each runner in each race checking for tied places (times are equal)
#   display the results using a format string
#   display times in minutes and seconds not just seconds

for race in df.columns:
    # race is a string containing the date of the race, eg '2019-01-28'
    # times is a pandas Series containing all the times of the race sorted in ascending order. If runner didn't run that race their time is dropped (dropna())
    # times.index is the names of the runners for those times. It is the index of the pandas Series times.
    times = df[race].sort_values().dropna()
    place = 0
    tied = 0  # number of runners with the same time for this race
    prev_time = -1  # time of previous runner. checking for ties
    # To loop through runner's name and time use .items() just as you would for a dict 'for key, value in dict.items():'
    for runner, time in times.items():
        if time == prev_time:
            tied += 1
        else:
            place += tied + 1
            tied = 0
            prev_time = time
        print('Race {race}: place {place} is {runner} with a time of {minutes:02d}:{seconds:02d}'.format(place=place, race=race, runner=runner, minutes=(int(time) // 60), seconds=(int(time) % 60)))
