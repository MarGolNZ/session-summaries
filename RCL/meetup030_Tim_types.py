Wednesday MeetUp 030 - Beginners Python Support Sessions - 02 Oct 2019 - Data types, Variables, Console, Program
Repeat of RCL meetups 001 and 018

Learning objectives:
    Data types: int, float, str, list
    Variables: create, assign, update
    Console: using the console for immediate response
    Program: putting multiple python commands in a script to run them all at once, for/while loop, if else

@author D Tim Cummings

Challenge 1: Install Software
    Python 3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
    PyCharm Edu 2019.2 from https://www.jetbrains.com/education/download/#section=pycharm-edu

    For those interested in my children's Python coding course
    see https://pythonator.com (makes Python coders out of gamers)
    This course would be good for adults too if they could play
    Minecraft or Minetest as well as the children!

Challenge 2: Browse courses in PyCharm Edu for "pythonator b1 easy" and do while waiting for others' installations

# Challenge 3: Using Python console to work with numbers and operators
#     Enter simple sums (eg 5+5) and press <enter> to see answer
#     Determine what each of the following operators do: + - * / // ** %
#     Advanced: Determine what these bitwise operators do: | & << >>

27 + 5   # 32  : addition
27 - 5   # 22  : subtraction
27 * 5   # 135 : multiplication
27 / 5   # 5.4 : floating point division
27 // 5  # 5   : integer division
27 % 5   # 2   : remainder after integer division (modulo)
27 ** 5  # 14348907 : raised to the power of

14 | 7   # 15  : bitwise OR  1110 | 0111 = 1111 = 15
14 & 7   # 6   : bitwise AND 1110 & 0111 = 0110 = 6
5 << 1   # 10  : bitwise shift left 0101 << 1 = 1010 = 10
5 >> 1   # 2   : bitwise shift right 0101 >> 1 == 0010 = 2

# Challenge 4: Storing values in variables in console
#     Store numbers in variables (using =)
#     What is the difference between int and float number types
#     Store text in variables (Using "" or '' or """""" or '''''')
#     Store results of formula in variable
#     Display contents of variable
#     Replacing contents of variable with another value (eg increment by 1)
#     Advanced: What do type(), str(), repr() tell you about a variable eg type(my_var)

a = 12   # int
b = 29   # int
c = 3.14  # float
d = 3.0   # float
# int are integers or whole numbers so they have no decimal places
e = 250000000000000000000000000000000
f = 25 / 7
i = e // 7
# ints can have more significant digits than floats (about 17)
# floats can't store decimal numbers exactly so good for science but not for accounting (use cents for accounting)
g = 1.1 + 2.2  # 3.3000000000000003

s1 = "hello"
s2 = 'world'
s3 = """pythonistas"""  # you can also include new lines in triple double quoted string
s4 = '''rejoice'''      # you can also include new lines in triple single quoted string
s5 = "Don't fret"
s6 = '''He said "Why don't you?"'''
s7 = 'He said "Why don\'t you?"'
s1  # displays contents of s1 in console (not when run from a program) as internally represented (surrounded by quotes)
print(s1)  # displays contents as non technical user would want it displayed.
print(type(s1))  # displays the type of the data stored in s1 eg <class 'str'>
print(repr(s1))  # displays internal representation of variable, In the console print(repr(v)) should be same as v
print(str(g))  # converts data to string before printing

# Escape characters - used to change meaning of character
# \' changes ' from end of string mark to single quote (when string starts with single quote)
# \" changes " from end of string mark to double quote (when string starts with double quote)
# \\ changes \ from escape character to back slash
# \n changes n from the letter n to a new line
# \r changes r from the letter r to a carriage return
# \t changes t from the letter t to a tab

# Challenge 5: Using operators with text
#     Determine what each of the following operators do on text: + * (str + str and str * int)

print("well " * 3 + " three holes in the ground")

# Challenge 6: Create a list. (comma separated sequence of values surrounded by square brackets)
#     Show the first item in the list. (use [0])
#     Show the last item in the list. (use len())
#     Change the third item.
#     Change the last item.
#     Advanced: What do the following slicing operations do? [1:4], [:3], [-3:]
#     Advanced: Try all these operations on a str and see which ones work

my_list = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
my_list[0]
print(my_list[0])
print(len(my_list))
print(my_list[len(my_list) - 1])
print(my_list[-1])
my_list[2] = "four"
my_list[-1] = 'blast off'
print(my_list[1:4])  # items with index 1 to 3
print(my_list[:3])  # items with index up to but not including 3
print(my_list[3:])  # items from index 3 on
print(my_list[-3:])  # items starting from 3 from right hand end to the right hand end

s = 'abcdefg'
print(s[0])
print(len(s))
print(s[-1])
# s[len(s) - 1] = 'b'  # strings don't support item assignment because they are immutable
print(s[1:4])  # chars with index 1 to 3
print(s[:3])  # chars with index up to but not including 3
print(s[3:])  # chars from index 3 on
print(s[-3:])  # chars starting from 3 from right hand end to the right hand end

# Challenge 7: Write a program which displays each member of a list on a new line (use print())
#     Advanced: Write program to display every second member of the list on a new line

# Challenge 8: What do the conditional operators mean: >, <, ==, !=, >=, <=, in (Advanced is)

# == is equal to
# != is not equal to
# >  is greater than
# <  is less than
# >= is greater than or equal to
# <= is less than or equal to
# in is in the sequence
# is is identical to
